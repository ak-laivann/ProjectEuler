# _Project Euler_

This Repository contains the answers to the problems of the questions from [project euler](https://projecteuler.net/archives).

Feel Free to study the code but first try those yourself.

I have used `javascript` since i am most comfortable in that language and sometimes in `python` also.

I plan to use `Kotlin` since i want to get acquainted in that language too.

Most of the solution would be brute force, and at times i will try and optimize them based on whether the problem was interesting or not.
